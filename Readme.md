### A shiny app to autofill marks from a Banner Course Component Template

## Instructions

1. Enter the course component as it appears on Banner and the header with the relevant component scores
in your marksheet should be the same (eg. CWS2WEEk6).

2. Upload the template file for the course component as exported from Banner. **This file should be in the *.xlsx* format**.

3. Upload your marksheet. For now the best thing is to download marks from moodle. Keep the downloaded sheet as is but change the 
headers for the scores to match their component name on Banner (eg. CWS2WEEk6).

4. Download the file using the button. This file should be able to be imported into Banner as is!!!
